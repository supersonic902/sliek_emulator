# sliek_emulator
I am trying to make a emulator that can play multiple game types, no selling of this software but modification is allowed, so you can use add on and mods, eventually I will try to make games for it for people to buy

I am trying to create a versatile game emulator that can play at least GBA, DS (not 3DS since nintendo will come after this emulator and me), SNES, NES, GameBoy Color, the Original Gameboy, and hopefully much much more.
